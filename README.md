# wit-wpt-go

Experimental WIMSE WIT/WPT & SPIFFE support in Go along with examples of WPT
usage on various protocols.

Much of the functionality here may eventually end up merged into
`spiffe/go-spiffe`.

As per https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-wimse-s2s-protocol/

It should go without saying that this code is currently not production ready
and is mostly hacked together :')
